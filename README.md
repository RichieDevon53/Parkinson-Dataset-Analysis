## Parkinson's Disease Analysis in Elderly Patients
### Introduction

This project aims to analyze the increasing number of Parkinson's disease diagnoses among elderly patients in Hospital A. The project utilizes data visualization, descriptive statistics, and inferential statistics to identify key factors influencing the development of Parkinson's disease. The ultimate objective is to reduce the incidence of Parkinson's among elderly patients by 10% within 1-2 years through targeted preventive efforts.
### Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to assist Hospital A in identifying the lifestyle and medical factors that contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease among its elderly patients. By understanding these factors, the hospital can implement preventive measures and interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of Parkinson's disease in the surrounding community.
Problem Statement

Hospital A has observed an increase in Parkinson's disease cases among its elderly patients, particularly those from the local community. The hospital aims to reduce the prevalence of Parkinson's by 10% over the next 1-2 years through preventive strategies informed by data analysis. This project seeks to identify the key determinants of Parkinson's disease in this population, enabling more effective prevention and treatment strategies.
### SMART Framework
- Specific: Reduce the prevalence of Parkinson's disease among elderly patients in the community.
- Measurable: Achieve a 10% reduction in Parkinson's cases among the elderly population.
- Achievable: Conduct data-driven analysis to identify key risk factors and implement targeted interventions.
- Relevant: Preventing Parkinson's disease in vulnerable populations will improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare burdens.
- Time-bound: The project aims to achieve its goals within 1-2 years.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes various factors such as patient demographics, medical history, lifestyle choices, and other relevant data points. The data was collected from Hospital A's patient records and will be analyzed to identify patterns and correlations related to Parkinson's disease.


### Analysis Process
1. Data Cleaning: The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data exploration to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the dataset.
3. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to identify significant factors contributing to Parkinson's disease.
4. Visualization: Data was visualized using various graphs and charts to present the findings clearly and effectively.
5. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, recommendations for preventive measures were made to help reduce the incidence of Parkinson's disease.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python: The primary programming language used for analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For statistical analysis and machine learning models.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the analysis process.

### Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to Parkinson's disease among elderly patients at Hospital A. The analysis has led to actionable recommendations that can help the hospital implement preventive measures, potentially reducing the incidence of Parkinson's disease in the community.
